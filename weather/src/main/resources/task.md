The task is more or less this: having XML file with [weather stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_station#Personal_weather_station) and their readings (*.csv) (which can be generated by running `UglyDataGenerator`):

* import stations to the DB (table `station`)
* import readings to the DB (tables `temperature_reading` and `wind_reading`)
* generate simple text files (one sentence is okay), one per each station, denoting min and max temperature and wind speed.

Please note, that each station can report readings using different units whereas in the DB we want to have metric units (metres per second and Celsius) only.

(Please keep in mind that this exercise is oversimplified, this is not how proper synoptic reports shall be done.)
